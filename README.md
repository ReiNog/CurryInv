________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
**I am at the first steps of a very long devlopment project. Expect to see new code every week and lots of changes to the codes already published.<br>
At this stage I am concerned with building the MVP of the platform for personnal use.**<br>
*The code (mostly) works, but it is not production ready from a professional development point of view.*<br>
*Important things like unit tests, exception handling, logs, access management etc will be added along the way.*<br>
